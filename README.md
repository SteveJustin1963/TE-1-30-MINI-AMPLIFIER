This 4-Transistor COMPLEMENTARY PUSH-PULL amplifier is designed around discrete components to show the basics of audio amplifier design. This type of circuit requires relatively few components, needs no transformers and provides very good results. The four transistors are directly coupled and DC feed-back loops help stabilize working conditions throughout. Transistors 3 and 4 are arranged as a complementary pair operating in pushpull. Each output transistor deals with one half of the audio cycle, one being cut-off when the other is driven into conduction. This is economical on battery current, which is quite low with moderate volume, rising to 25 - 30ma as volume is increased. This gives us a 250 milliwatt amplifier, enough to drive a loudspeaker to the same volume as a transistor radio. The first two transistos operate as a pre-amp to increase the incomming voltage to drive the output pair The bias of the whole circuit commences with the voltage divider made up of the 56k and 100k resistors. This provides the base with a bias voltage of 5.5v The emitter voltage will be .6v less than this, and will be 4.9v The second transistor is biased so that it provides a voltage across the 270 ohm load resistor which will give the output transistors a voltage differential of .6v between their base and emitter leads. This is needed to reduce cross-over distortion which occurs whenever two transistors are connected in push-pull. The 100mfd electrolytic prevents DC from appearing across the speaker which would "off set" the cone. The DC would pull the cone in a little and require the speaker to oscillate around this new position. The amplifier may be driven from a ceramic cartridge in a record player or across the volume controlof a transistor radio. The input must be about 100 - 500 millivolts to drive the amplifier fully. A small piece of veroboard 20 - 25 holes long is needed for the amplifier. Make a layout diagram first which very nearly follows the schematic diagram before attempting any soldering. With care you will find you will not have to cut any of the veroboard tracks and most of the parts will fit neatly onto the board as they all .1" spacing. When you have completed soldering, connect the battery via a milli-ammeter to check that the current is within 30ma and most probably be 5 - 15 ma with no input signal applied. You may like to trace through the amplifier with the signal tracer from the previous project and satisfy yourself where the amplification is performed and where voltage comparisons are maintained. Obviously all the stages cannot provide amplification since a transistor can achieve a gain of at least 20 times and sometimes an in-circuit gain of 100. Thus this amplifier would achieve at least 20 x 20 x 20 or 8,000 times! But this is not so. With the input requirement of about 250 milli-volts the amplifier needs to provide a gain of about 40 to 80 times. Your signal tracer will indicate which transistor is providing this gain. See for yourself. In all, these combined 5 transistor projects should give you hours of fun.
